# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

It is hosted at: https://openhousedb.org

### Local Development
First install npm packages:
```
$ npm install
```

To bring up the service, run:
```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
Server should be brought up at http://localhost:3000/

### Adding new documentation
Follow user guide in [docusaurus.io/docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) to add new documentation. Particularly [Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages), [Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction), [Blog](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog).

A special flavor of markdown [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) is used by default for all md files by Docusaurus. It is more powerful with its javascript integration.
